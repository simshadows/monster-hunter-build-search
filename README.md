# Sim's Monster Hunter Build Search Tools

**CURRENTLY AN EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS.**

Automatically searches for optimal builds for the Monster Hunter games!

I'm only implementing searches for the games I play, and so far, these are:

- *Monster Hunter World* (and its expansion *Monster Hunter World: Iceborne*), and
- *Monster Hunter Rise*.

**NOTE:** The Rise codebase is mostly the World codebase and is still being adapted for Rise.

## Planned Changes

I'm interested in merging the codebases together somehow, probably through some common library.

But for now, each game will have its own fully-contained codebase until I can figure out the best approach.
